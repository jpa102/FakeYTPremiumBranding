# Fake YouTube Premium Branding
don't have the money to get youtube premium? well, now you technically can!

with this userscript, it replaces the standard YouTube branding to just Premium in the topbar (and sidebar)

i don't know what you will do with this, maybe show off to everyone that you have "bought" YouTube Premium?

## important Notice:

this userscript **DOES NOT** give you YouTube Premium features, it only **replaces** the *svg branding* to make it appear you have one

you really need to be a **"hackerman"** in order to get yourself youtube premium

the "closest" you can get in having one of premium features is *no ads* by using [ublock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) browser extension
